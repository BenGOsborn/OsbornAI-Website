## Whats the purpose of the website?

The website acts as a platform for us to connect with clients that would like to scale their business using advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence by providing them with a way to inquire about a consult. The website also provides data science related content that aim to inform and teach users in the form of articles. Examples of articles written by us include tutorials on data analytics, building machine learning models, and information regarding the data science industry. Our website also acts a platform for us to be able to track the analytics of our business, and provides us with the ability to accept payments from our clients.

## What technologies are we using?

The website is built with JavaScript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular framework for building hybrid static and server rendered websites that builds on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). This allows for the information on our website to be accessed by web crawlers, as well as providing users with a smooth experience when navigating the website. The backend of the website is built using Python and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), a library for Python that simplifies the process of creating a web server. The database that is being used with the backend is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database. For accepting payments we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Both the frontend and backend are deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a popular cloud platform service for deploying apps, providing users with an option of free hosting with all the features needed to deploy their website, and a paid option giving the user access to the tools needed to take their website to the next level.

## Analytics

The website uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to track a users interactions with the website. It allows one to track specific events, such as if a user clicks a button or visits a page. It also allows one to track other statistics such as the country in which users are accessing the website from, where the website is receiving its traffic from, or the type of device that the users of the website are using. These statistics allow us to improve our website for our users and to create better, more useful content. We have installed Google Analytics on our website using [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) which provides a way to add a variety of tracking services to a website and provides a way to define specific events to be tracked without needing to modify the code of the website besides the initial install of the tag manager.
