## Analytics
The website uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to track the user interactions with the website. It allows one to track specific events, such as if a user clicks on a button, or if a user has visited a page. It also allows one to track other statistics such as the country in which users are accessing the website from, where the website is receiving its traffic from, or the type of device that the users of the website are using. These statistics allow us to improve our website for our users and to create better, more useful content.
