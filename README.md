## What technologies are we using?
The website is built with JavaScript using Facebook's [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), which is a popular framework for building a responsive frontend for a website. The website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages), a React.js library that allows developers to deploy their React application to GitHub with ease. The backend of the website is built using Python and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), a library for Python that simplifies the process of creating a web server. The database that is being used with the backend is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database. For accepting payments we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). The server is hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), a simple and free way of deploying a web server to the internet.
