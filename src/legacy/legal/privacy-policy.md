### Why we collect your data

Here at OsbornAI, we understand the importance of data, and therefore it is essential for us to track specific metrics to help us better understand our own business, allowing us to make more impactful decisions and to improve the experience of our viewers and potential/current clients.

<br />

In this policy we aim to help you understand how we collect your data, what we use the collected data for, and the decisions you have regarding your data on this website.

<br />

### How we collect your data and what we use it for

Our site has various methods of collecting data from you. The following will disclose how we collect this data, and what we will and won't do with your data.

<br />

When you inquire about a consult, the personal data you submit to our inquiry form (your first name, last name, email and inquiry, and the time and date the inquiry was submitted) will be kept on record in our database. It should also be noted that the time and date of which you submitted the inquiry will also be stored in your local storage, so that you can see the time remaining before you are allowed make another inquiry. We will use this data to follow up with you about your inquiry via email. We keep this data on record so that we can view your previous interactions with our business such as the work we have done with you in the past. We may also attach the email you used to make an inquiry with to a payment ID we may create for you. This payment ID will expire, along with the email attached to it after 7 days if no payment occurs. If a payment is made using this payment ID, the email and the rest of the details connected to the payment ID will be stored privately along with the details regarding the transaction. This personal data that you disclose with us through the inquiry form will be kept private and will not be shared and/or sold to any third party companies. We will use the time and date at which the inquiry is recorded to prevent you from making any further inquiries within 10 days, to help avoid the spamming of our systems.

<br />

When you make a payment with us, the email you inquired with and the email you used to make the payment will be stored, along with the details of the transaction. We will keep this data on record so we can view your history with our business, eg. the amount of money you have paid our company in the past, and the kind of services that you payed us for. This will help us to determine the most effective services we should provide to you should you choose to work with us again. Upon completing a transaction, your card details will not be shared with us and will instead be sent to Stripe to complete the transaction, along with the email you used to make the transaction. Here your card details and email will be stored safely and securely. You and Stripe will be the only two parties who know your card details. Neither us or Stripe will ever make a request to charge your card without your consent.

<br />
