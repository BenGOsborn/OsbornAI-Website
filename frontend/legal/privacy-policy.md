When you inquire about a consult, the personal data you submit to our form (your first name, last name, email and inquiry) will be kept on record. We will use this data you have sent us to follow up with you about your inquiry via an email regarding your inquiry. We will also keep this data on record so we can view your history with our business, eg. if you have worked with us before and the work you have done with us if applicable. We may also use the email you share with us to view the individual of whom our payment ID is intended for. This personal data that you disclose with us will be kept private and will not be shared with any third parties.
